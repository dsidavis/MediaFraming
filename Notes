# General background:

For tomorrow ( 27 Oct )

- Make the houses glyph (house name + sample size)
- Get 3 together on the same page
- Get dervs. - get fast change - ID lags
- Pro before Con, etc.
- Big Pro. followed by big con?




  - they did a term search on 5 topics, immigration, death penalty,
    same-sex, smoking, guncontrol (todo: climate change, ...)
  - Read ~3000 articles per topic by hand (multiple coders per, defined codebook)
  - got more docs (~30K) and coded by ML

TODO: Send email for the plots that she was interested in.

Duncan also has some docs - want to focus on the data on github (is this public?)

Potential plots/EDA:

1) look at all frames, pro + con
2) public opinion
3) connect to individual articles
4) events
5) understand why changes in # of articles

p = primary frame
b = occurs anywhere in body

Look at where the p's are close, maybe plot top 3 frames. 
Look at polling numbers vs. articles #, tone
